- 👋 Hi, I’m @missjennyo.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything! No, seriously. If you have a project or hobby that you are passionate about, I want to hear all about it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games more quickly with RPG Maker and Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting! I am knee-deep in a few projects at the moment, but would love to plan for when those are done.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by email, at jenniferannobed@gmail.com.
