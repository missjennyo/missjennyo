- 👋 Hi, I’m @missjennyo
- 👀 I’m interested in everything! No, seriously. If you have a project or hobby that you are passionate about, I want to hear all about it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games more quickly with RPG Maker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting, though I am knee-deep in a few projects at the moment.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by email, at jenniferannobed@gmail.com.
